## Abstract

We use the general framework of summation by parts operators to construct conser-
vative, entropy-stable and well-balanced semidiscretizations of two different nonlinear
systems of dispersive shallow water equations with varying bathymetry: (i) a variant
of the coupled Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (BBM) equations and (ii) a recently proposed
model by Sv√§rd and Kalisch (2023) with enhanced dispersive behavior. Both models
share the property of being conservative in terms of a nonlinear invariant, often inter-
preted as entropy function. This property is preserved exactly in our novel semidis-
cretizations. To obtain fully-discrete entropy-stable schemes, we employ the relaxation
method. We present improved numerical properties of our schemes in some test cases.
